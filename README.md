# Word Frequency Counter

## Overview

This project implements a simple web application that analyzes the frequency of words input by a user. It's designed to provide immediate feedback on the most commonly used words in a given text snippet. By entering text into a textarea and clicking the submit button, users can see a table that displays the top five most frequent words along with their corresponding counts.

## Learning Journey

Embarking on this project, I delved into the intricacies of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS integration. The process sharpened my understanding of DOM manipulation as I dynamically created elements based on user interaction. I learned to manage and link external files such as style sheets and scripts to HTML, ensuring a separation of concerns and cleaner code architecture.
